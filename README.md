# RPN-Soft
A Toolbox for Compute a Pomset Bisimulation and Unfolding for Reset Petri Nets

RPN-Soft, a toolbox that implements a set of definitions necessary to define a pomset bisimulation of reset Petri nets and to compute the finite prefixes of unfolding of reset Petri nets. This tool paper is an implementation of the concepts developed in the paper entitled "Pomset Bisimulation and Unfolding for Reset Petri Nets"
